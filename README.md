# Domain and Webhosting
- To publish a website one needs a domain for example mybeautifuldaycare.org
	- while .org top level domains, this is how the last part of a domain is called, are relatively expensive at about 20$ p.a. this would be the optimal top level domain.
	- Domains can be purchased on a per year basis, for example on the German site https://www.hetzner.com/ or on international sites like https://www.godaddy.com/ or https://www.namecheap.com/
	- I personally recommend hetzner
- The second component is a server, that is a computer that is always connected to the internet. For simple websites such a server is called web space and often comes in tandem with a domain. Webspaces are usually paid monthly and cost anywhere from 2.00-10.00$ a month
	- Companies that provide webspaces are colled **hosters**
	- One German hoster with a payment model that allows for very cheap monthly costs (1,00€) is Uberspace https://uberspace.de/en/, for this 1,00€ no domain is included per default, this needs to be purchased extra
	- Hetzner too has webspaces starting from 2.09 € per month including a domain. Which is very cheap when a .org domain is used: 25.08 € per year, considering a .org domain costs 18.00 € that is only 7.08 € for hosting. https://www.hetzner.com/webhosting/
	- Other international options might work too, but I cannot recommend them personally

# The actual Website
- Once you have a domain and a server you can start thinking about the website.
- There are two concepts: a fully custom website vs. a content management system (CSM)
I will try to compare them for you:
Fully custom:
- You program everything yourself in the languages of the web (HTML, CSS and Javascript). This approach is extremely flexible, because you can do just about anything.  However changing something, for example adding a new child to the page requires the use of one of the aforementioned programming languages and is hard to do for a non technical user.
CMS:
- A CMS is used to make it as easy as possible for the end user to change the content. This however comes at the cost of flexibility. The most common CMS is called wordpress, which has evolved from a personal blogging software to a very capable CMS. Wordpress allows the user to create new pages and change them all in the web browser (like Firefox or Chrome).

Given that the goal is easy maintenance for non-technical users Wordpress would be the system of choice. There are other less popular CMS but this is not really relevant for you.

Here is the overview over Wordpress: https://wordpress.com/
You will need to install wordpress on the webspace, then you can start setting up the website.
Here is an overview over the quickstart https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/get-started-with-wordpress/

Wordpress is based around a concept called themes. A theme is a prefabbed  website that can be filled with content. The theme changes the look of your page. Themes can be downloaded and installed for free from https://de.wordpress.org/themes/browse/new/. Be aware that some of the themes might require a purchase.

# Donations
- while it is relatively hard to provide a secure payment gateway (the option for a donator to pay on your website) you can just write the banking information.
- Another option, or an additional option, is paypal donate https://www.paypal.com/donate/buttons which is free for non-profits, as far as I am aware of. You will just need to apply for a business account which might take a while (took two weeks the last time I did it.)
